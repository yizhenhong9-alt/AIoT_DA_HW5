Who are the victims? Two students were killed, and a further nine people are being treated. Medics say one person is in a critical condition, six are "critical but stable", and two others are less severely hurt. The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students. "This is a day that we hoped never would come to our community. It is deeply devastating for all of us," she said in a statement. A ninth victim did not suffer a gunshot wound, according to police, who said they suffered non-life threatening injuries from fragments from the shooting "that had occurred near them".

The attack targeting the Jewish community at a Hanukkah event in Australia is "sickening", Sir Keir Starmer has said. At least 11 people were killed in the shooting at Bondi Beach on Sunday and a further 29 taken to hospital, according to police. In a statement on X, the UK prime minister said: "The United Kingdom will always stand with Australia and the Jewish community." He added that the government was working with Community Security Trust, a Jewish security organisation, on the policing of Hanukkah events in the UK. The Metropolitan Police said it was increasing its "police presence, carrying out additional community patrols and engaging with the Jewish community to understand what more we can do".
